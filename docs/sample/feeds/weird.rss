Like back in the day... if ya know what I mean.</p><p> Interesting timing on that... because I was interviewing a woman. AND... because she’s just simply maaarvelous... the interview went swimmingly.</p><p> In fact... I learned some pretty life changing thangs.</p><p>So... with the hope and expectation that it’ll do the same for you, too... my producer Joe Nation and his team hit the “publish” button.</p><p>Therefore... you can click here and maybe... hopefully... I hope... no, I pray... in the name of all things good and holy... it’ll change your life, too.</p><p>All the best, Doberman Dan</p>]]>
